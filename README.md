# Generating The Data
In order to use my code, run the run.sh script.

This generates most of the data/charts used in the paper.
There is also a folder called legacy in the main drivers section that I am not sure are still fully functional.

I completed a major overhaul of the structure of my project to improve maintainability.

You can still see how the data was gathered in the legacy drivers - these were only used during the generation portion of the project (part 1).  

The rest of the main drivers are in the top level of main drivers.
